Running file "main_pb.py".

The script works with data from the file "phonebook.json".

When the script is running, the presence of a data file is not necessary, but the address pocketbook is empty (file "phonebook.json" is absent).

When the script ends correctly and if the address pocketbook is not empty, the session data is will overwrite to the file "phonebook.json".
